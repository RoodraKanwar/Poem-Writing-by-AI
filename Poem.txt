To me death is unavoidable 
in the ascidia waiting for 
in its transparent bell or 
have mouth her to my 
mouth or the eternal to 
think i don t water 
of your voice your hands 
your mouth your eyes are 
the thousand years you are 
the queen to you beloved 
and in my mouth and 
in its rock around the 
world safe in the midst 
of its love what sorrow 
are you are to the 
moon that is a man 
and they tell you fell 
in you everything sank whose 
your voice your mouth your 
hands was to the eternal 
surf to time and nothingness
